\textbf{Euler, Milstein and higher order discretization schemes}\\
An Euler scheme is a good first-order approximation, but the  accuracy can improve when employing a Milstein scheme instead. However, if we use a Milstein scheme the stochastic differential equations should meet certain conditions about the differentiation of the diffusion coefficient. Due to the additional complexity of this condition, it is sometimes mandatory to opt for an Euler scheme.\\
