abstract = {The objective of this article is to evaluate the performance of the option pricing model at the cross-sectional level. For that purpose, the authors propose a statistical framework, in which they in particular account for the uncertainty associated with the reported pricing performance. Instead of a single figure, the authors determine an entire probability distribution function for the loss function that is used to measure the performance of the option pricing model. This method enables them to visualize the effect of parameter uncertainty on the reported pricing performance.},
