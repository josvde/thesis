\section{Monte Carlo Pricing}

In this thesis we will use SVMs to model stochastic processes for variance and we will rely on numerical MCSM methods to find expected realized volatilities under $\mathbb{Q}$ as given in~(\ref{eq:sqrProcess}). We use MCSM methods since there are no analytical expressions available for the models we are considering. However, under certain simplifying assumptions for the Heston model (see infra), such expressions can be found and are discussed. Nevertheless, these formulas still have shortcomings, and we will discuss why MCSM methods are a better choice to fully capture the price-variance dynamics of the full Heston model.\\
